To Install React Vite with Tailwind follow Steps mentioned in the website: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
I've added font "Poppins" From website : https://fonts.google.com/
Also, with that i have added font-awesome libraries from : https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome

First I created a "Hero" component which is the landing page of the website 

Then i created a "generator" component which has  "SectionWrapper" as its child .

Also this "Generator" component has another function Called Header just to add a 
Header because i didnt wanted to create a seperate component to write just a 
heading "Pick your poison" & "Seclect the workout plan you endure".

In section wrapper i have three DIVs

First "Div"  wraps type of potion which gets all the four poison using map function to map them with button
I've used useState function to paint the screen with click in poison button


Second "Div" wraps muscle groups which are different for different poison so on click of posion we set the
posion variable and then take the muscle group from array of each poison,now because 'individual' posion is
a array and rest are nested array so ive added a conditional statement such that individual posion is selcted it return
the array otherwise for rest of the posion it return the key of the nested array ,all the muscle are wrapped under buttons.
Ive created a function named updateMuscles to let user select more than on muscle at a time if
